Andrei,Andrei,majesticbeach23jw@rediffmail.com,Hi, 
 
I'm Andrei, a marketing manager at Traffic Buddy. I came across www.danpezzin.com and see that it has the potential to get a lot more visitors to really BLOW UP in 2015! 
 
I just wanted to tell you, in case you didn't already know... We cater to over 7,000 small and medium biz and website owners - many in your niche, all seeing a TON more sales, subscribers and clickthroughs. 
 
We're network partners with the largest media banner networks - the same networks that serve traffic to hundreds of thousands of popular news, cooking, animal, research, shopping, etc websites you already use daily. 
 
Simply put, I think www.danpezzin.com can get a lot more exposure from buying and driving traffic the same way all of these other successful websites have been doing for so long! 
 
Let me give you all the details here:
