# Variables SSE, RSS, and TSS are in memory

# The coefficient of determination, also known as R-Squared, is a great measure of linear dependence. 
# It is a single number which tells us what the percentage of variation in the target variable is explained by our model.
# R^2=1âˆ’(SSE/TSS)=(RSS/TSS)

# Compute the R-Squared for our model, linearfit. Assign the R-squared to variable R2.
R2 = RSS/TSS
