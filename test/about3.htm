                        Hi! I’m Dan Pezzin. I love business and technology. 
						I decided computers were really cool during my senior 
						year at SJJ ‘07 (link) when a buddy from yearbook class 
						showed me how to Photoshop his face onto an NBA poster. 
						The timing was perfect! Everyone was getting their college 
						acceptance letters and .edu email addresses, so we all signed 
						up for Facebook at the exact same time. I became an expert at 
						downloading profile pictures and uploading my own funny 
						Photoshopped versions of friends with celebrities. It 
						helped me learn basic computer skills and the fundamentals 
						of the windows directory structure without having to learn 
						how to read code. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I decided not to pursue computer science in college, because 
						code looked like gibberish to me and all the symbols were 
						intimidating. Instead, I got my undergrad degree in business 
						from the University of Toledo, majoring in entrepreneurship 
						and marketing. On the side, I spent free time teaching myself 
						how to build apps on my original Motorola Droid with Google’s 
						App Inventor. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        App Inventor was the second best discovery I have ever made. 
						The Droid was a popular phone at the time. My friends all had 
						them too, so my apps ran on all of our phones. There was no 
						code to learn with App Inventor. The controls were all drag and 
						drop, so it was really easy to pick up. App Inventor projects 
						still had the capability to use advanced features like GPS and 
						messaging. You could also download open source App Inventor 
						projects that other people have built and make changes to them. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Even though I have upgraded to building more complex apps with 
						Java now, my favorite Android app I have ever built was my second 
						App Inventor project. It let me hack my friend’s text messages and 
						auto reply with my message instead. For two hours, his phone was 
						telling everyone “I need to call you back I’m busy putting on 
						lipstick and dresses.” I thought it was awesome that I could use 
						technology to pull pranks on my friends in college and I wanted to 
						learn more, but I wasn’t sure how. 
                    </p>
         
                    <p>
                        Earlier I said that App Inventor was my second best discovery. The 
						very best discovery I have ever made was the free online computer 
						science program offered by the <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/">Harvard Extension School</a>. 
						All of the lectures are recorded on Harvard’s campus and uploaded 
						to the course websites. They go pretty fast.  I had to pause the 
						videos a lot to take notes, but the material is covered in perfect order. 
						I took <a href="http://computerscience1.tv">CS1</a>, <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a>, <a href="https://cs75.net/Main_Page">CS75</a>, 
						<a href="http://cs76.tv/2012/spring/">CS76</a>. I recommend <a href="http://computerscience1.tv">CS1</a> as a perfect introduction to anyone looking 
						to improve their overall computer skills. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a> and <a href="https://cs75.net/Main_Page">CS75</a> are 
						introductory programming classes and <a href="http://cs76.tv/2012/spring/">CS76</a> covers mobile development. 
						I was comfortable with most of the front-end technologies after taking 
						these courses, but less comfortable with the backend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then I came across a program funded by the Department of Labor. It was called .NET Code Reconnect. They are trying to turn Detroit, Michigan into the technology capital of the world by offering free Microsoft courses 480, 483, and 486, but I have heard there are similar programs across throughout the United States. The material covered the .NET framework version 4.5, C#, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and building applications with MVC4. The program was hard to get into. They only accepted candidates with a college degree who could pass two interviews, a background check, and a 30 question entrance exam,  but I would recommend these programs to anyone who has time to apply. I learned a ton and it’s actually the reason I’m building this website right now and many more projects to come. Stay tuned.
